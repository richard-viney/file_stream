  /// Data in subsequent `file_stream.write_*` calls are buffered until at least
  /// `size` bytes are buffered, or until the oldest buffered data is `delay`
  /// milliseconds old. Then all buffered data is written in one operating
  /// system call. The buffered data is also flushed before some other file
  /// operations that are not `file_stream.write_*` calls.
  ///
  /// The purpose of this option is to increase performance by reducing the
  /// number of operating system calls. Thus, `file_stream.write_*` calls must
  /// be for sizes significantly less than `size`, and should not interspersed
  /// by too many other file operations.
  ///
  /// When this option is used, the result of `file_stream.write_*` calls can
  /// prematurely be reported as successful, and if a write error occurs, the
  /// error is reported as the result of the next file operation, which is not
  /// executed.
  ///
  /// For example, when `DelayedWrite` is used, after a number of
  /// `file_stream.write_*` calls,
  /// [`file_stream.close()`](./file_stream.html#close) can return
  /// `Error(FileStreamError(Enospc)))` as there is not enough space on the
  /// device for previously written data.
  /// [`file_stream.close()`](./file_stream.html#close) must be called again, as
  /// the file is still open.

  /// This mode is ignored on the JavaScript target.

  Exclusive

  /// Allows much faster access to a file, as no Erlang process is needed to
  /// handle the file. However, a file opened in this way has the following
  /// limitations:
  ///
  /// - Only the Erlang process that opened the file can use it.
  /// - The `Encoding` option can't be used and text-based reading and writing
  ///   is always done in UTF-8. This is because other text encodings depend on
  ///   the `io` module, which requires an Erlang process to talk to.
  /// - The [`file_stream.read_chars()`](./file_stream.html#read_chars) function
  ///   can't be used and will return `Error(Enotsup)`.
  /// - A remote Erlang file server cannot be used. The computer on which the
  ///   Erlang node is running must have access to the file system (directly or
  ///   through NFS).
  /// 
  /// This mode is ignored on the JavaScript target.

  /// The file, which must exist, is opened for reading.
  Read

  /// Activates read data buffering. If `file_stream.read_*` calls are for
  /// significantly less than `size` bytes, read operations to the operating
  /// system are still performed for blocks of `size` bytes. The extra data is
  /// buffered and returned in subsequent `file_stream.read_*` calls, giving a
  /// performance gain as the number of operating system calls is reduced.
  ///
  /// If `file_stream.read_*` calls are for sizes not significantly less than
  /// `size` bytes, or are greater than `size` bytes, no performance gain can be
  /// expected.
